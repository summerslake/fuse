> ### 🏌️ Fork: remote multiplayer
>
> This branch adds **remote multiplayer** — two people in different houses, each
> with their own launch monitor, playing one round shot by shot with live ball
> flight on both screens. A full 9 holes has been played over the internet on OGS
> Desktop with Square launch monitors. It also supports two local players sharing
> one machine plus a third playing remotely.
>
> **Start here: [docs/MULTIPLAYER.md](./docs/MULTIPLAYER.md)** — what it does, how
> it works, the wire protocol, and what's deliberately hacked around not
> controlling OpenGolfSim's infrastructure.
>
> To play: [docs/HOSTING.md](./docs/HOSTING.md) (host) ·
> [docs/PLAYING-WITH-A-FRIEND.md](./docs/PLAYING-WITH-A-FRIEND.md) (guest).
> `MULTIPLAYER_PLAN.md` is the working log, including things tried and abandoned.
>
> Proof of concept, not production: see *Known gaps* and *What's deliberately
> hacky* in the doc above.

### Building Courses

We have an all-in-one course building tool called **Meshery** for building courses that work with the FUSE course player. If you are just getting started or want to build your a custom course, that's the best place to start.

### Building Games

You can also build fully custom games or simulator environments for FUSE using it as an SDK.

There are a couple ways to develop your own games locally.

#### Option A: Run in OpenGolfSim Desktop

You can build and test games that live on your local filesystem and run inside OpenGolfSim Desktop, with just a few simple steps.

  <!-- - First you'll need to register for a developer account (reach out on our [Discord](https://help.opengolfsim.com/connect-with-us/)) -->

  1. First, create a new folder for your project in the OpenGolfSim `fuse` directory

      **Windows**
      ```
      %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\opengolfsim-desktop\fuse\MyAwesomeGame
      ```
      
      **Mac**
      ```
      ~/Library/Application Support/opengolfsim-desktop/fuse/MyAwesomeGame
      ```

  1. Add a `game.json` file to your project folder. This will act as the manifest for your game.

      ```
      {
        "name": "my-awesome-game",
        "version": "0.0.1",
        "title": "My Awesome Game",
        "description": "A custom golf simulator game for OpenGolfSim"
      }
      ```

      - `name`: Create a unique slug to use as your game ID
      - `version`: The current version of your game
      - `title`: The formatted title that will be displayed to users
      - `description`: A brief description of your game that will be displayed to users

  1. Add an `index.html` file, which will be the entrypoint of your game.

  1. Launch OpenGolfSim Desktop and you should see your game displayed in your game library.

  From here, you'll want to review our SDK documentation to learn how to initialize the game and receive shots from OpenGolfSim.

---
#### Option B: Build & Run From Source

You can checkout this repo to build and run our examples or develop your game against the source code, right in the browser.

1. Checkout this repo:

    ```bash
    git checkout https://github.com/OpenGolfSim/fuse.git
    cd fuse
    ```

1. Install the dependencies
    
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```


1. Then run the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

1. You should now be able to see and run the examples in your browser.
